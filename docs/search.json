    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote sensing is a technique for observing and measuring objects or phenomena by analyzing data collected from a location distant from the object or phenomenon, usually using aircraft or satellites.\nThe main features of remote sensing include:\n\nNon-contact observations: It is possible to make observations without coming into physical contact with the target by using remote sensing techniques. This is especially crucial for monitoring dangerous or inaccessible regions.\nWide-ranging coverage: It is challenging to conduct widespread remote sensing with ground-based observations. Instead, satellite or airplane platforms can cover large areas.\nMulti-spectral observations: Remote sensing techniques usually include observations in different wavelength ranges, such as visible, infrared and radar. This makes it possible to acquire different types of information.\nTime-series analysis: Changes in the environment or the land surface can be tracked and examined by routinely gathering remote sensing data for the same region.\nData processing and analysis: In order to extract valuable information from remote sensing data, specialist software is typically required."

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nAlso, remote sensing has two types.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrowave remote sensing is an example of active remote sensing, which actively produces electromagnetic waves and collects reflected signals for imaging. On the other hand, visible light remote sensing, which passively picks up electromagnetic waves that a feature emits or reflects, is an example of passive remote sensing. The imaging technique is the primary distinction.\nThe practical section focuses on how to get started with remote sensing data, with particular attention to the acquisition and processing of Sentinel and Landsat data. It covers the selection of source data, basic raster image statistics and processing, and an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the different software used. Methods for extracting and statistically comparing spectral signatures are also covered. For example, Nagendra’s study on biodiversity in 2001 solved some of the problems regarding the inability to identify the underlying areas through remote sensing techniques and their improvement."

Learning remote sensing involves not only understanding complex scientific principles and technical operations, but also interpreting and applying the data. This is a bit of a concern for me and tests my data handling skills more. This learning process enhances the ability to analyze and solve practical problems. I hope I can learn more later on."

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nHere are several types of correction.\n\nGeometric correction: Used to correct geometric aberrations in satellite or aerial images caused by the curvature of the earth, terrain relief, tilt angle of the sensor etc.\nAtmospheric correction: Used to remove the negative effects of changes in light intensity and wavelength due to the interaction of light with particles and gases in the atmosphere as it passes through the atmosphere, which can affect the accuracy of images and data captured by satellite or aerial sensors.\nOrthorectification correction: Corrects for image distortions due to satellite imaging angles, inhomogeneities in the Earth’s surface (e.g., mountains or buildings), and the curvature of the Earth. Satellite imagery is thus converted into a realistic, accurately scaled map representation so that each pixel of the image corresponds precisely to a specific geographic location on the Earth’s surface.\n\n(Radiometric Calibration: Ensure that images captured by satellite or aerial sensors are radiometrically accurate.)"

Image Enhancement, Contrast Enhancement…)\n\n3.2.1 Ratio\nAccording to the practice, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is primarily used to assess the density and health of surface vegetation. Based on the reflective properties of vegetation to solar radiation, especially in the red and near-infrared bands. Vegetation typically absorbs most of the red light (for photosynthesis) while reflecting more radiation in the near-infrared band.\nMy study area plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Texture\nTexture analysis enhances the identifiability of objects or surface features in an image, especially in areas of single color or brightness. It describes the roughness, smoothness, and spatial distribution of these features on the surface of an object. By evaluating the relative position of pixels to each other and variations in brightness, texture analysis helps to extract more information about the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuickBird test data acquired over the outskirts of Morgantown, WV, on 22 August 2002.(Warner, 2011)\n\n\n\n\nMy texture images looks very bad, so I use others. These images contains: the false color image on the left is probably going to be NIR, the image in the middle is a grayscale map of the red band, and the right is a grayscale map of the NIR band.\nIn this image we can see more clearly the farmland, houses, forests, etc. for further analysis.\n\n\n3.2.3 PCA\nPCA is a statistical method that transforms a set of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables by orthogonal transformation, which is widely used for dimensionality reduction, data compression and feature extraction. It is used in remote sensing to improve contrast and remove unnecessary information."

When the camera takes a picture of our face and produces distortions, we can use Photoshop to adjust it to what it was supposed to look like, which is same as correction in remote sensing. When we feel that the photos are not in focus, we can adjust the contrast to make the photos look better, which is the same as the essence of enhancement in remote sensing. I wish I will more familiar with the code, I spend 6 hours to complete practical this week!"
