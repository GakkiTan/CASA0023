This is especially crucial for monitoring dangerous or inaccessible regions.\nWide-ranging coverage: It is challenging to conduct widespread remote sensing with ground-based observations. Instead, satellite or airplane platforms can cover large areas.\nMulti-spectral observations: Remote sensing techniques usually include observations in different wavelength ranges, such as visible, infrared and radar. This makes it possible to acquire different types of information.\nTime-series analysis: Changes in the environment or the land surface can be tracked and examined by routinely gathering remote sensing data for the same region.\nData processing and analysis: In order to extract valuable information from remote sensing data, specialist software is typically required."

On the other hand, visible light remote sensing, which passively picks up electromagnetic waves that a feature emits or reflects, is an example of passive remote sensing. The imaging technique is the primary distinction.\nThe practical section focuses on how to get started with remote sensing data, with particular attention to the acquisition and processing of Sentinel and Landsat data. It covers the selection of source data, basic raster image statistics and processing, and an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the different software used. Methods for extracting and statistically comparing spectral signatures are also covered. For example, Nagendra’s study on biodiversity in 2001 solved some of the problems regarding the inability to identify the underlying areas through remote sensing techniques and their improvement."

Harbin has unique geographical advantages. Its land is black soil and is known as the “Granary of China.” In the early years of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, heavy industry was also vigorously developed in Harbin. The region’s rich oil resources were once known as the “cradle of socialist industrial construction.”\nIt is precisely due to excessive mining and crop planting that Harbin’s soil fertility has declined, and the land has even become desertified. Coupled with the development of heavy industry, rivers have become seriously polluted and the land has become salinized. In the past decade, China’s industrial structure has gradually shifted from heavy industry to light industry and high-tech. Heilongjiang Province’s per capita GDP has shown a rapid downward trend, and young people have gradually left their hometowns to work in big cities, resulting in a serious aging of the population in Harbin. Industrial transformation is also tending in an awkward situation.\nTherefore, there is a very sad saying among local university students: “For our generation, the purpose of studying is to leaving.”\nIn order to respond to the “Several Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Comprehensively Revitalizing Old Industrial Bases such as Northeast China” and revitalize Heilongjiang, the picture below shows remote sensing data of land use changes in Heilongjiang Province from 1980 to 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent land use categories and their changes in Heilongjiang from 1980 to 2020.(Jiang et al.,2023)"

The development of Heilongjiang has been impeded by improper land usage, which has intensified environmental risks.\nThe picture below is a water body map of four provinces extracted through MLP neural network based on Landsat8. It can be observed that the rivers in Harbin are distributed in a strip shape and are long and narrow. Therefore, once the water body is polluted, its self-purification ability will be very poor, and it will be difficult to restore the water body. Pollution from heavy industry requires a lot of time for rivers to recover, and efforts should be made to avoid industrial re-pollution of water.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extraction performance of different surface water types using MLP neural network, (a) river in Heilongjiang province, (b) lake in Tibet autonomous region, (c) aquacultural water in Jiangsu province, (d) sea water in Guangdong province.(Jiang et al.,2020)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the problems displayed by these maps, we can give some preliminary improvement methods. The first is to further return farmland to forest to avoid further weakening and erosion of black soil.\nSecondly, because Heilongjiang has a strong initial industrial accumulation, it can consider industrial transformation from heavy industry to light import and export industry. Harbin is near Russia in the north and the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea in the east, making import, export and transportation more convenient.\nIt is worth noting that Harbin is also very suitable for developing tourism. Due to Harbin’s high latitude, the outdoor temperature in winter can reach more than 20 degrees below zero. This year, the Heilongjiang Provincial Tourism Bureau has begun to vigorously promote Harbin’s “Ice and Snow World” project, which is to build large-scale ice sculptures and ice sculpture amusement facilities. According to a report from Time Weekly, from January 1 to 3, 2024, tourism revenue of nearly 6 billion yuan was achieved. This amazing rate of return makes it worthwhile for the Tourism Bureau to continue to improve tourism-related supporting facilities and promote the further development of its tourism industry."

One of the most noteworthy is that causality is not clear, e.g. correlations observed from remotely sensed data do not necessarily reflect causality. In the case of this illustration, surface temperature anomalies could be the result of environmental changes or the effect of other unobserved variables. This makes the picture complex and still requires subsequent data analysis and processing. And there is a lack of ground validation, with limited ground observations available in many cases. These may be attributed to the limitations of the model and algorithms, which need to be followed up with continuous improvement in order for us beginners to get a better handle on observing remote sensing images."

    "text": "6.1 Summary\nThis week’s study of decision trees, I was also learned in another course. It is mainly used to solve classification and regression problems. This week’s lecture introduced the topic through some environmental problems (which was very interesting because I want to write about it for my dissertation) and then talked about what classification and regression trees (CART) are.\nPrinciple：The CART model constructs a decision tree by recursively partitioning the dataset into smaller subsets while creating a decision node for each subset.\nDifference：\nClassification trees are used for the prediction of discrete response variables. They create partitions by maximizing the impurity between different classes, and commonly used impurity measures are the Gini index or entropy.\nRegression trees are used for the prediction of continuous response variables. They create partitions by minimizing the total squared error in each partition (i.e., the sum of the squares of the differences between the values at each node and the actual values at all points in the node).\nWhen a decision tree is overfitted, the problem needs to be mitigated by pruning, setting a maximum depth, or requiring a minimum number of samples contained in a node.\nRandom Forest：Improve overall prediction accuracy by combining predictions from multiple decision trees.\nRandom forests then solve the overfitting problem of the decision trees just mentioned, with random feature selection and self-sampling, random forests are less prone to overfitting than individual decision trees.\nImage classification：Aims to classify pixels in remote sensing images into different categories to identify and analyze different features of the ground surface, such as vegetation, water bodies, roads, buildings, and so on.\nUnsupervised does not require large amounts of training data to be collected and labeled beforehand, and is suitable for situations where labeled data is lacking or costly to obtain.\nClustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) are applied to automatically group pixels into classes based on their spectral features. These algorithms attempt to cluster pixels with similar features together to form class clusters.\nSupervised evaluates the accuracy of the classification by comparing the classification results to a set of independent validation samples of known class.\nMaximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) is a widely used supervised classification technique. Classification is performed by estimating the probability that a pixel belongs to each predefined category.\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) is used to solve classification and regression problems.SVM aims to find optimal boundaries (called hyperplanes) between different classes to maximize the edges between different classes. This method is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and is therefore well suited for processing multi-band remote sensing data."

Generally speaking, locations with smooth surfaces, greenery, and woods have lower sampling densities. Certain events, such snow, construction, and street repaving, can cause a temporary or total loss of MP. When analyzing DInSAR data, two primary target kinds can be taken into account(Ferretti et al., 2000). Typically, persistent scatterers (PS) are point-like primary targets that respond steadily to SAR microwaves over an extended period of time. PS are typically found in large quantities on structures, wires, utility poles, antennas, bare rock, etc. DS(distributed scatterers) can be found in desert regions, cultivated fields, dispersed outcrops, areas covered in rubbish, etc. While A-DInSAR processing techniques focus only on PS or DS, several hybrid approaches have been proposed over the past decade.\nAlthough I did not find examples of blending, I did find examples of DInSAR in 3D. the 3D positions have an uncertainty of a few meters. Therefore this aspect to consider when interpreting is related to the geometry of the SAR image and the orbital tube, which directly affects the accuracy of the terrain error.\nBelow is a warehouse at a freight terminal in the Tuscany region of central Italy.DInSAR not only examined the commercial area, including several buildings, but found evidence of a persistent settlement phenomenon (cracks, foundation problems) caused by the consolidation of highly compressible organic and clay soils that characterize the subsurface of the area(Ciampalini et al., 2019). 3D geolocation was also performed, based on subpixel location analysis and local-scale data correction supported by external positioning data (e.g., ground control points or LiDAR point clouds) to ensure more accurate geolocation. for subsequent analysis and resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeolocation accuracy in the Livorno freight terminal, western Tuscany. Displayed numbers refer to the accuracy of the height estimation with respect to the reference DEM (in meters); (B) Mining-related subsidence in the North Rhine–Westphalia region, western Germany. Background image is an AGEA orthophoto 2016 for inset A and an ESRI World Imagery for inset B(Crosetto et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n\nDInSAR technology has undergone tremendous development over the past two decades. The most important result of this development has been the ability to process large volumes of SAR imagery, thus enabling wide-area DInSAR monitoring programs. In general DInSAR is capable of detecting extremely small surface deformations (millimeter scale), thus detecting subtle changes in the surface, which is important for disaster prevention and management."

    "text": "8.3 Reflection\nThis week’s study was about SAR, I was more concerned about the difference between SAR and DInSAR, then I realized the amazing difference between the two.SAR mainly detects the surface condition, while DInSAR detects the subtle changes on the surface, so it can be said that DInSAR is an advanced version of SAR. For the current global warming problem, DInSAR will have more to build on this problem.\nIt’s the last week of notes, and it feels like time is going by so fast, and this seems to be my last class in university. I hope I can graduate successfully!"
