    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote sensing is a technique for observing and measuring objects or phenomena by analyzing data collected from a location distant from the object or phenomenon, usually using aircraft or satellites.\nThe main features of remote sensing include:\n\nNon-contact observations: It is possible to make observations without coming into physical contact with the target by using remote sensing techniques. This is especially crucial for monitoring dangerous or inaccessible regions.\nWide-ranging coverage: It is challenging to conduct widespread remote sensing with ground-based observations. Instead, satellite or airplane platforms can cover large areas.\nMulti-spectral observations: Remote sensing techniques usually include observations in different wavelength ranges, such as visible, infrared and radar. This makes it possible to acquire different types of information.\nTime-series analysis: Changes in the environment or the land surface can be tracked and examined by routinely gathering remote sensing data for the same region.\nData processing and analysis: In order to extract valuable information from remote sensing data, specialist software is typically required."

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nAlso, remote sensing has two types.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrowave remote sensing is an example of active remote sensing, which actively produces electromagnetic waves and collects reflected signals for imaging. On the other hand, visible light remote sensing, which passively picks up electromagnetic waves that a feature emits or reflects, is an example of passive remote sensing. The imaging technique is the primary distinction.\nThe practical section focuses on how to get started with remote sensing data, with particular attention to the acquisition and processing of Sentinel and Landsat data. It covers the selection of source data, basic raster image statistics and processing, and an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the different software used. Methods for extracting and statistically comparing spectral signatures are also covered. For example, Nagendra’s study on biodiversity in 2001 solved some of the problems regarding the inability to identify the underlying areas through remote sensing techniques and their improvement."

Satellite imagery is thus converted into a realistic, accurately scaled map representation so that each pixel of the image corresponds precisely to a specific geographic location on the Earth’s surface.\n\n(Radiometric Calibration: Ensure that images captured by satellite or aerial sensors are radiometrically accurate.)"

When the camera takes a picture of our face and produces distortions, we can use Photoshop to adjust it to what it was supposed to look like, which is same as correction in remote sensing. When we feel that the photos are not in focus, we can adjust the contrast to make the photos look better, which is the same as the essence of enhancement in remote sensing. I wish I will more familiar with the code, I spend 6 hours to complete practical this week!"

    "text": "4.1 Summary\nThe city I chose is Harbin, which is in the most northern province in China. As we all know, China’s main productive force is the primary industry. Harbin has unique geographical advantages. Its land is black soil and is known as the “Granary of China.” In the early years of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, heavy industry was also vigorously developed in Harbin. The region’s rich oil resources were once known as the “cradle of socialist industrial construction.”\nIt is precisely due to excessive mining and crop planting that Harbin’s soil fertility has declined, and the land has even become desertified. Coupled with the development of heavy industry, rivers have become seriously polluted and the land has become salinized. In the past decade, China’s industrial structure has gradually shifted from heavy industry to light industry and high-tech. Heilongjiang Province’s per capita GDP has shown a rapid downward trend, and young people have gradually left their hometowns to work in big cities, resulting in a serious aging of the population in Harbin. Industrial transformation is also tending in an awkward situation.\nTherefore, there is a very sad saying among local university students: “For our generation, the purpose of studying is to leaving.”\nIn order to respond to the “Several Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Comprehensively Revitalizing Old Industrial Bases such as Northeast China” and revitalize Heilongjiang, the picture below shows remote sensing data of land use changes in Heilongjiang Province from 1980 to 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent land use categories and their changes in Heilongjiang from 1980 to 2020.(Jiang et al.,2023)"

    "text": "4.2 Applications\nThe main data used in this map are meteorological data, digital elevation model data (DEM) and land use data.\nThe reduction of unused land and forest areas, as well as the harvesting, use, and reclamation of forest land—such as converting farmland back to forest and afforestation—are plainly visible on the remote sensing-produced map above(Jiang et al.,2023). The development of Heilongjiang has been impeded by improper land usage, which has intensified environmental risks.\nThe picture below is a water body map of four provinces extracted through MLP neural network based on Landsat8. It can be observed that the rivers in Harbin are distributed in a strip shape and are long and narrow. Therefore, once the water body is polluted, its self-purification ability will be very poor, and it will be difficult to restore the water body. Pollution from heavy industry requires a lot of time for rivers to recover, and efforts should be made to avoid industrial re-pollution of water.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extraction performance of different surface water types using MLP neural network, (a) river in Heilongjiang province, (b) lake in Tibet autonomous region, (c) aquacultural water in Jiangsu province, (d) sea water in Guangdong province.(Jiang et al.,2020)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the problems displayed by these maps, we can give some preliminary improvement methods. The first is to further return farmland to forest to avoid further weakening and erosion of black soil.\nSecondly, because Heilongjiang has a strong initial industrial accumulation, it can consider industrial transformation from heavy industry to light import and export industry. Harbin is near Russia in the north and the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea in the east, making import, export and transportation more convenient.\nIt is worth noting that Harbin is also very suitable for developing tourism. Due to Harbin’s high latitude, the outdoor temperature in winter can reach more than 20 degrees below zero. This year, the Heilongjiang Provincial Tourism Bureau has begun to vigorously promote Harbin’s “Ice and Snow World” project, which is to build large-scale ice sculptures and ice sculpture amusement facilities. According to a report from Time Weekly, from January 1 to 3, 2024, tourism revenue of nearly 6 billion yuan was achieved. This amazing rate of return makes it worthwhile for the Tourism Bureau to continue to improve tourism-related supporting facilities and promote the further development of its tourism industry."

One of the most noteworthy is that causality is not clear, e.g. correlations observed from remotely sensed data do not necessarily reflect causality. In the case of this illustration, surface temperature anomalies could be the result of environmental changes or the effect of other unobserved variables. This makes the picture complex and still requires subsequent data analysis and processing. And there is a lack of ground validation, with limited ground observations available in many cases. These may be attributed to the limitations of the model and algorithms, which need to be followed up with continuous improvement in order for us beginners to get a better handle on observing remote sensing images."

And just some simple Javascript writing, which is better for those of us who are not familiar with the code.\nGoogle’s pioneering in maps is something I’ve always admired, I’ve enjoyed looking at live satellite maps on Google maps before, because he often captures some very interesting images, I’ve even seen my friends :) and the challenge of guessing regions on live satellite maps on the Youtube before was also very interesting, which is a great way for outsiders to get a better understanding of the geographic world, and a great way for insiders to get a better understanding of the world of geography. GEE in a way could work similarly for us, except that the term remote sensing can sound disinteresting, but it’s actually quite inspiring. I think I’ll spend more time with GEE and try to find out some of its hidden “tricks”."
