## Summary

Two types of sensor: active and passive. (Which we have learnt at week1)

**SAR** works by utilizing the properties of radar wavelengths to detect conditions on the ground. It is mounted on satellites or airplanes that transmit radar waves to the ground and collect the signals reflected back. Unlike optical remote sensing, SAR is able to operate at night or in cloudy and rainy weather conditions because the radar waves can penetrate clouds and a certain level of vegetation.
